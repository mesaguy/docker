# Bootable container images
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mesaguy/docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mesaguy/docker)

## Purpose of images
This is a collection of bootable container images. These Docker images are intended for use when running tests against numerous Linux distributions. For instance, these images can be utilized by (Rspec)[http://rspec.info], (Serverspec)[https://serverspec.org/], and (Inspec)[https://github.com/inspec/inspec] tests. These Docker images should not be used to deploy applications or be used in any form of production capacity.
