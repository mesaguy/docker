# Bootable docker images

## Purpose of images
This is a collection of bootable docker images. These Docker images are intended for use when running tests against numerous Linux distributions. For instance, these images can be utilized by (Rspec)[http://rspec.info], (Serverspec)[https://serverspec.org/], and (Inspec)[https://www.inspec.io] tests. These Docker images should not be used to deploy applications or be used in any form of production capacity.

Links to the official EOL information for the distribution images that I maintain can be found below. Distributions that rely on continuous rolling releases (ie: Arch, Gentoo, Amazon) are never EOL and do not have EOL documentation:
